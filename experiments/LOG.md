# S6E8 experiment log

Diagnostic rows use a **stratified 80,000-row train subsample**, 3 folds, seed 42.
They rank hypotheses. They are **not** competition scores. A result counts only when
`diagnostic` is false, `n_splits=5`, full train, and `oof/<name>/metrics.json` exists.

| experiment | hypothesis | change | CV AUC | fold std | runtime | conclusion | next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline_diag80000 | Current ratios + n_missing are a fine GBM start | LightGBM, 17 cols | 0.953145 | 0.000256 | 18s | Control. Engineering is not free. | Compare raw |
| lgbm_raw_diag80000 | Ratios dilute raw usage | All engineering off | **0.954115** | 0.000345 | 18s | **+0.001 vs baseline.** Drop the ratio/leisure/n_missing block. | Keep raw as default feature set |
| lgbm_strong3_mean_diag80000 | Skip-NA mean of daily/weekend/social fills missing daily | raw + `strong3_row_mean` | 0.954120 | 0.000293 | 18s | Flat vs raw. Worse on the daily-missing slice (0.9149 vs 0.9153). Trees already use surrogates. **Stop.** | Do not ship this feature |
| histgb_raw_diag80000 | Different tree family, same raw cols | sklearn HistGB | 0.954050 | 0.000357 | 12s | Matches LightGBM. Corr 0.989. | Blend partner |
| xgb_raw_diag80000 | Third boosted-tree family | XGBoost hist | 0.952247 | 0.000398 | 28s | −0.002 vs LGBM. Not worth extra complexity at these params. | Stop unless GPU/tune later |
| lgbm_usage_core_diag80000 | Original-noise columns can be dropped | Drop cats + notifications + app_opens | 0.938491 | 0.000541 | 9s | **−0.016. Failed.** Notifications/app_opens are weak univariate but high GBM gain on playground. | Split the drop |
| lgbm_nocat_diag80000 | Only categoricals are noise | Drop gender/stress/academic | **0.954317** | 0.000303 | 15s | Small gain vs raw. Best single model in this ranking. | Full 5-fold on Kaggle |
| logreg_raw_diag80000 | Surface is nearly linear in usage | Logistic + median impute | 0.911040 | 0.001395 | 1s | Far below trees. Corr 0.87 with LGBM, but too weak to help a mean blend. | Not a stacker at this strength |
| histgb_nocat_diag80000 | HistGB on the nocat feature set | HistGB + drop cats | 0.953985 | 0.000313 | 10s | Matches LGBM within 0.0003. | Blend with lgbm_nocat |
| blend_nocat_diag80000 | Complementary tree errors | Grid 0.55 LGBM + 0.45 HistGB | **0.954887** | — | — | +0.00057 vs best single. Corr 0.990 — small, consistent lift. | Repeat on full 5-fold OOF |

## Answers so far

**What actually determines `addicted_label`?**

- Original 7,500-row source: label is exactly `addiction_level ∈ {Moderate, Severe}`. A depth-3 tree of `daily_screen ≳ 8` or `social_media ≳ 4` already has ~0.99 AUC. Notifications, app opens, cats, gaming, work are ~0.50 there.
- Playground keeps the ~71% positive rate and the usage ranking, but **smooths** the hard rule (continuous daily AUC 0.890 >> stump 0.81) and **masks** ~14% of daily_screen (MCAR vs label).
- Playground also **entangles notifications and app_opens with the label via interactions** that do not exist in the original table (original LGBM is flat/better without them; playground LGBM loses ~0.016 AUC if they are dropped). Keep those two columns.
- Categoricals remain noise on both tables. Safe to drop.
- `id` is a sequential split, not a leak. Train/test value drift is negligible.

**What model fits this generator?**

- Trees, not linear models (logreg 0.911 vs GBM 0.954 on the same 80k protocol).
- LightGBM ≳ HistGB > XGBoost at the default-ish params used here.
- Explicit coverage features (`strong3_row_mean`) and the original OR-score do not beat native missing handling.

**Is CV trustworthy?**

- Fold std ≈ 0.0003 on 80k×3. Rankings are stable. Absolute 80k AUC is **not** the leaderboard number; full 691k×5 still has to be run on Kaggle Kernels.

**Complementary errors?**

- LGBM vs HistGB Pearson ≈ 0.99. Grid blend still adds ~0.0006. Logreg is more complementary and too inaccurate. Do not average in failed ablations (`usage_core`).

## Recommended next Kaggle Train jobs (full 5-fold)

1. `configs/lgbm_nocat.yaml` (CPU) — primary single model.
2. `configs/histgb_nocat.yaml` (CPU) — blend partner.
3. After both OOF files exist: `python scripts/blend_oof.py --experiments lgbm_nocat histgb_nocat --method grid`.

Do not submit to the leaderboard unless the workflow input `submit_to_kaggle=true`.

## Not worth more budget

- Baseline ratio engineering.
- `strong3_row_mean` / `strong3_row_max` / `or_usage_score` for GBMs.
- Dropping notifications or app_opens.
- Mixing original 7,500 rows into train (component dependence differs: original `daily` ⟂ social+gaming+work; playground never violates `daily ≥ sum`).
- Wide hyperparameter search before the two full 5-fold runs above.
